Vermist Dust Sector is a weekly-run, private [Impstation](https://github.com/impstation/imp-station-14) instance that aims to provide a slower pace than Impstation proper. What if I want to play lowpop at 4PM? What then?

---

Vermist Dust Sector is a closely linked fork of Impstation, which is a fork of Space Station 14, a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.

While we are not a server that allows sexual content, <b>we do not allow people under the age of 20 to play on Vermist.</b>

## Documentation/Wiki

SS14's [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.com/) has documentation on SS14's content, engine, game design, and more.

## Contributing

We are happy to accept contributions from anybody. However, unless your changes would fit the low-pop Vermist atmosphere more, it's [likely better to contribute to Impstation instead](https://github.com/impstation/imp-station-14). We always make sure we're up to date!

If you do wish to contribute to Vermist in particular, our PR guidelines are pretty much the same as Imp's. As a baseline make sure your changes and pull requests are in accordance with the upstream [contribution guidelines](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/codebase-info/pull-request-guidelines.html). We're generally not as strict, but it's good practice to follow these examples.

If you are adding completely custom content that would go into the normal SS14 file structure in a certain spot, add that content to the `_VDS` folder with that same file path instead. For example, when adding the `ServerChatOOCColorManager.cs` chat manager for OOC color stuff, it would have gone in `Content.Server/Chat/Managers`. Instead, the `ServerChatOOCColorManager.cs` file is in `Content.Server/_VDS/Chat/Managers`.

The Vermist Dust Sector folders are located at `Content.Client/_VDS`, `Content.Server/_VDS`, and `Content.Shared/_VDS`. The Resources folder is kind of its own beast, and has a lot of depth. For that reason it makes sense to have the _VDS folder inside the subfolder it is modifying. As another example, the main prototypes folder for our custom content is located in `Resources/Prototypes/_VDS`. This applies for recipes, clothing, everything.

Keeping things defined like this makes the lives of the people maintaining the server much, much easier.

We are not currently accepting translations of the game on our main repository. If you would like to translate the game into another language, consider creating a fork or contributing to a fork.

## AI-generated contributions disclaimer
This project does not accept low-effort or wholesale AI-generated contributions. Examples include, but are not limited to:
